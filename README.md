## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at 42 school Paris.  
Passionate about algorithms and opimisation, I discovered graphics programming a bit by chance, and since then I've had a lot of fun because it's a field that encourages us to make the most of every computer resource. And when the result is a beautifully lit scene, it's a joy to behold.
